      productName: 'One Fast Cat Exercise Wheel',
      src: `${image1}`,
      price: 199.99,
      description: `Think of this as a much cooler, more sophisticated hamster wheel, designed to be cleaned easily and with materials that help claws from catching. Your cat can hop on or hop off whenever the urge arises — and don't be afraid to use treats or toys to make the game even more fun.`,

      id: '1',
      productName: 'Kitty Holster Cat Harness',
      src: `${image4}`,
      price: 32.99,
      description: `With cats being indoors full-time, it's almost impossible to get them outside for some exercise. Most cats seem to despise wearing a harness, and when you finally risk your limbs and eyeballs to get them into one, they just as quickly slip out of it. This harness is ultra-comfortable but it's real claim to fame is that it's almost impossible to escape from. Perhaps now the neighbour's dog won't be the only one out for a stroll.`,

    {
      id: '2',
      productName: 'Whisker City Organic Catnip',
      src: `${image3}`,
      price: 5.49,
      description: `Bring out your cat's inner hippie with some catnip! If you can't seem to get your cat interested in toys or play time, sprinkle some of this herb on his mouse stuffie and your Fluffy will seem like a kitten again.`,
    },
    {
      id: '3',
      productName: 'Petsafe Busy Buddy Barnacle',
      src: `${image6}`,
      price: 12.95,
      description: `Boredom and frustration are barriers to your cat's happiness. By allowing your cat to "forage" — to work hard to get food — you can alleviate much doldrum from your cat's life. Because your cat has to really try to get the food out of this nifty gadget, the access to calories is limited. If you had to walk to the store every time you wanted a cookie, you might eat fewer cookies right?`,

      id: '4',
      productName: 'Da Bird Go Cat Pull Apart Rod and Bird Cat Feather Toys',
      src: `${image5}`,
      price: 17.73,
      description: `How could we possibly overlook the good ol' fashioned, tried and true, feather toy? Cats love to chase and pounce around the living room for hours. This one is particularly popular with cat lovers because it pulls apart for easy storage, and it outlasts the competition.`,
    },
    {
      id: '5',
      productName:
        'Cat Amazing - Best Cat Toy Ever! Interactive Treat Maze & Puzzle Game for Cats by Cat Amazing',
      src: `${image2}`,
      price: 54.71,
      description: `Some toys are just genius. Place your cat's food in this box and watch them immerse themselves in the instinctual world of hunting, scratching, and sniffing. Not only is it made of cardboard (which we love), but it's so simple to put together, and it allows for varying degrees of difficulty.`,
